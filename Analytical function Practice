### Comparing Dense_rank() and Rank()

use Asgn;
show tables;
select * from employees;

SELECT employee_id, first_name,
       department_id,
       salary,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary) AS Salary_Ranking
FROM   employees
where department_id=6;

SELECT employee_id, first_name,
       department_id,
       salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary) AS Salary_Ranking
FROM   employees
where department_id=6;

### Comparing LEAD AND LAG

SELECT employee_id, first_name,
       department_id,
       salary,
       #LAG(salary, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS previous_sal,
       salary - LAG(salary, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS salary_diff_to_prev
FROM   employees;


SELECT employee_id, first_name,
       department_id,
       salary,
       LEAD(salary, 1, 0) OVER(PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary) AS Next_sal,
       salary - LEAD(salary, 1, 0) OVER(PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary) AS salary_diff_to_Next
FROM   employees;
